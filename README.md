# Operation Free TV on Mobile 

Goal: Have a free way to view the latest TV Shows in an app without having to view ads. 

## How
After finding a website which hosted the TV shows I enjoyed, I wrote a script which would first find all the video links on the website for a given TV show and store them in a database. Then I created a dynamic phone app using ReactJS which would read the video links from the database and stream them right from my phone! You can read more about the challenges I faced by visiting the links below!

Part 1: Scrape the TV website which has the TV Shows and upload the mp4 links along with episode data to Firebase. </br>

Part 2: Create a dynamic React-JS app movie template which will read mp4 links from Firebase and allow you to view them in the app.
