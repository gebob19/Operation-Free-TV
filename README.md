React-JS-Movie-Template: https://github.com/gebob19/react-movie-template

Goal: Have a free way to view the latest TV Shows in an app without having to view ads. 

Part 1: Scrape the TV website which has the TV Shows and upload the mp4 links along with episode data to Firebase. </br>

Part 2: Create a dynamic React-JS app movie template which will read mp4 links from Firebase and allow you to view them in the app.
