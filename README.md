Goal: Have a free way to view the latest TV Shows without having to view ads. 

Part1: Scrape the TV website which has the TV Shows and upload the mp4 links along with episode data to Firebase.
Part2: Create a dynamic React-JS app movie template which will read mp4 links from Firebase and allow you to view them in the app.
